Vim Terminal with Suboptimal Monokai color
Most terminal color schemes use 256 colors. Here a 16 color version is presented. You need reset your color palette. What's more, to make italic fonts work, add following into your vimrc:
set t_ZH=[3m
where ^ stands for ctrl+v, and the first [ stands for esc
the second [ is a plain left square bracket

Your terminal palette:

Text : #F8F8F2

232526 | EF5939 | FD971F | E6DB74 | 70F0F0 | BCA3A3 | 960050 | 465457
808080 | F92672 | A6E22E | C4BE89 | 66D9EF | AE81FF | 7070F0 | F8F8F0

this configuration balances between monokai palette and monokai palette.
